#Problem Summary
##Replace every occurrence of && with and, but only if it has a space before and after it.
##Replace every occurrence of || with or, again, only if it is surrounded by spaces.
##Do not change && or || if they're not surrounded by spaces.
##These symbols will never appear at the start or end of a line.

    line = re.sub(r'(?<= )\|\|(?= )', 'or',line)
